# Advent of code 2022

> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.

Each day of December poses a new 2-part challenge of varing difficulty.

This repo contains my solutions, written in Python.
